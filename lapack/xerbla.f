*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> XERBLA  is an error handler for the LAPACK routines.
*> It is called by an LAPACK routine if an input parameter has an
*> invalid value.  A message is printed and execution stops.
*>
*> Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to
*> call system-specific exception-handling facilities.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] SRNAME
*> \verbatim
*>          SRNAME is CHARACTER*(*)
*>          The name of the routine which called XERBLA.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          The position of the invalid parameter in the parameter list
*>          of the calling routine.
